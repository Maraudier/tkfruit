Crossentropy Notes
An Example:
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
             loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
             metrics=['accuracy'])

https://keras.io/losses/
In order to evaluate the model, we need to evaluate the model based on several metrics including "loss". "Loss" is the difference between reality and what is predicted.

Use this crossentropy loss function when there are two or more label classes. We expect labels to be provided in a one_hot representation. Categorical crossentropy is the difference between an output tensor and a target tensor.



tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses/SparseCategoricalCrossentropy?version=nightly

If you want to provide labels as integers, please use SparseCategoricalCrossentropy loss. There should be # classes  floating point values per feature. This computes the crossentropy loss between the labels and predictions.
