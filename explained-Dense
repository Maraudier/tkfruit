tf.keras.layers.Dense

Dense implements the operation:
    output = activation(dot(input, kernel) + bias), where
        activation: the element-wise activation function passed as the activation argument
        kernel: a weights matrix created by the layer
        bias: a bias vector created by the layer (applicable only when use_bias=True)
