**Problem:** During multiple stages in produce sales, retailers often receive unlabeled boxes
containing fruit, some of which does not meet quality standards set forth by the company.
Sorting fruit by hand can be expensive and time-consuming.


**Solution:** A CNN model trained to distinguish fresh apples, fresh oranges, fresh bananas,
rotten apples, rotten oranges or rotten bananas to increase quality control efficiency for the fruit
retailer. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks, a model was created that accomplished
this goal with a high level of accuracy.
